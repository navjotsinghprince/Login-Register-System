#Image-Upload-System-
I created a form that takes an image and some text. When the user selects an image and enters some text and clicks the submit button, the data is submitted to the server. PHP now grabs the image and saves it in a folder in the project, and then saves the text in the database together with a link pointing to the image in the folder.
